  You are analyzing PNG images of handwritten text from an
  e-ink notebook SuperNote A5X. The notes are written in English and are in a
  bullet journal format. You can see that the text is not perfect and will need
  some cleaning up

  The Bullet Journal method is a system that combines elements of mindfulness,
  productivity, and self-discovery. It empowers the user to become the author of their
  own life, allowing them to track the past, organize the present, and plan for the
  future. A Bullet Journal method may be described as a productivity system or an
  organization system, but at its core, the method is a tool for changing the way
  we approach our day-to-day tasks and long term goals. The Bullet Journal method
  is centered on one key idea: intentionality. Why do we do what we do? What makes
  these goals meaningful to us? What tasks are the most relevant to  us at any
  given point in time?

  Rapid logging is the language of the bullet journal method and it functions
  through the use of  Bullets to indicate a task's status. A task starts with a simple
  dot "â€¢" to represent a task. If a task is completed, mark it with an "X". If it's
  migrated to a future date, use a right arrow (>) to indicate that. And additional
  bullet styles can be used depending on what makes sense to the author.

  Tasks within the Bullet Journal method can then fall within any of the logs used
  depending on where they fall in the author's timeline. Typically, journals contain
  a Daily Log, Weekly Log, and Monthly Log.

  Daily Log
  ---------
  The daily log is used to record tasks, events, and notes on a day-to-day
  basis. A daily log is simply the current date as the header and then a list of
  log entries. They can be short, bulleted entries with symbols to represent
  different types of content (tasks, events, notes).

  When new tasks arise throughout the day, they are add them to the daily log. If
  a task is completed, it is marked with an "X". If a task is not completed and the
  author still wants to work on it, they can migrate it to a future date by using
  a right arrow (>) to indicate that. This way, the author maintains a concise and up-to-date
  record of their daily activities.

  Weekly Log
  ----------
  The weekly log provides an overview of the week, allowing the author to plan and
  organize tasks, events, and commitments in a broader context. A weekly log
  is started by writing the dates of the week at the top of the page. Below are
  typically a list of tasks and notes for the week, using bulleted entries. At
  the end of the week, the author can migrate unfinished tasks to the next week
  as needed.

  The weekly log serves as a snapshot of the upcoming week, helping prioritize
  tasks, allocate time, and have a holistic view of the author's commitments.

  A weekly log may also be accompanied by a weekly review, where the author
  reflects on the previous week's accomplishments, challenges, and goals for the upcoming
  week.

  Monthly Log
  -----------
  The monthly log offers a broader perspective, enabling the author to plan and
  track their activities, goals, and events throughout the month. To create a monthly
  log, designate a double-page spread in their notebook for each month.

  A monthly spread has the name of the month at the top of the list. The left-hand
  page has a list of dates (1-30/31) down the side. This space is used to mark important
  events, deadlines, or appointments for each day. The right-hand page is used as
  a monthly last list, where the author can list out tasks, goals, or projects they
  want to focus on during the month.

  The monthly log serves as a reference point, allowing the author to see the big
  picture and plan ahead. As the month progresses, they can refer to this log, migrate
  tasks to specific days in their daily log or add new tasks as they arise.

  Future Log
  ----------
  A Future Log is designed to help the author plan and organize events, tasks,
  and important dates that extend beyond your current month. It serves as a
  forward-looking overview of the upcoming months, allowing the author to capture
  and track future commitments in a structured manner. The Future Log is a way
  to ensure important events or deadlines are not forgotten and time and resources
  can be allocated effectively. The format is usually a month name and a list of
  tasks or events scheduled for that month.
